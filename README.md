# Simple-Counter


## Functionality

The app contains:

- A counter display that shows the current count
- An increment button to increase the count by 1
- A save button that saves the current count into the total 
- A display that shows the saved total
- Reseting the counter resets the count back to 0

## Implementation 

This is implemented using:

- HTML for the UI structure
- CSS for styling 
- JavaScript for the counter logic and interactivity

The `increment()`, `save()`, and other functions handle updating the DOM elements to showcase the correct counts.

## Usage

To use:

- Click the increment button to increase the counter 
- When ready, click the save button to add it to the total
- Continue incrementing and saving to add to total
- Saved totals persist on resetting counter

This allows counting anything needed and preserving the totals.
